56 free and open source Music Icons for use with Logic Pro X and other DAWs in five tasty colors. Inspired by the Erthbound Brand. Created by yours truly

To install for use with Logic Pro X, extract the folder from the .zip file that you downloaded by double clicking it.

Then, open Logic Pro X, right click (control + click) on a track's default icon, click the "Custom Icons" tab, and then the plus sign.

In the finder window that opens, navigate to your extracted folder (the one that showed up when you double clicked on the .zip), navigate into a color subfolder of your choice (colors: plum, mint, cherry, zest, or sno cone), select each icon in that folder (command + a), and finally press "Open".

The menu will close. Right click (or command + click) the track's icon again and navigate to the custom icons tab again. Your custom icons will now be there.

Repeat these steps to add each additional color.

If at any time you'd like to access the custom icons that Logic has stored, they are in:

(user folder)/Music/Audio Music Apps/Custom Icons

Since logic stores custom icons here once you import them, you may delete the .zip and the extracted folder if you wish to do so.

Enjoy!

With love from Eric at Erthbound Productions.
